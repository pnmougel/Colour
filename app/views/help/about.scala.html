<p>The colour ranking is based on the idea that no one knows better the quality of a journal or a conference than the members of its research community. 
Our objective is to gather this information through votes in order to provide an accurate score regarding the quality of a publication</p>
 
<h6>Collaborative ranking</h6>
 
We want this website to be as much collaborative and community oriented as possible. 
 
<h6>Scoring method</h6>

<p>To be as exhaustive as possible, the scores are based on two sources:
<ul>
    <li>User votes</li>
    <li>Scores from external ranking, e.g., Core, Microsoft Academic Research or Google Scholar</li>
</ul>

<p>You can get detailed information on how the scores are computed from this different sources by visiting the sections <a href="/help/user_scores">User scores</a> and 
<a href="/help/external_scores">External scores</a>.</p> 

<h6>Authors disclaimer</h6>

<p>The authors strongly believe that a research evaluation based only on the ranking of the journals or conferences leads to bad pratices. 
However, it remains a good indicator and as such we hope that the colour ranking will be helpful.</p>
